## What is DaVinci Resolve Studio?

**DaVinci Resolve Studio** is the definitive, industry-leading software suite for professional video post-production, combining high-performance editing, Hollywood-caliber color correction, advanced visual effects (VFX), professional audio post with Fairlight, and now cutting-edge AI tools via the DaVinci Neural Engine, all within a single, unified application. Unlike basic editors, DaVinci Resolve Studio provides a complete, end-to-end workflow that allows creators, colorists, editors, VFX artists, and sound engineers to collaborate seamlessly on the same project timeline without ever needing to export or switch between different programs.

This powerful software is trusted by major Hollywood studios, broadcasters, and independent filmmakers worldwide for projects ranging from blockbuster movies and television series to online content and corporate videos. Its non-linear editor (NLE) is incredibly fast, the color grading panel is unparalleled, and the Fusion VFX compositing environment rivals dedicated effects software. By integrating every stage of post-production into one tool, DaVinci Resolve Studio drastically streamlines workflows, enhances creative possibilities, and ensures the highest quality output for any video project, from social media clips to 8K feature films.
